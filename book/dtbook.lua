-- dtbook.lua - the one piece of the design that TeX macros cannot do cleanly.
--
-- \code{...} typesets assembly, numbers and Boolean expressions exactly as they are written in the
-- lectures. \detokenize gets most of the way, but leaves two artifacts: it doubles every #, and it
-- puts a space after every control word. Assembly rarely meets either, but the lectures' text
-- blocks and the Windows calculator's key names do, so both are undone here. A line break is
-- allowed after a comma with no space behind it, so a list such as 00,01,11,10 can break rather
-- than run into the margin.

local catcode_other = -2

function dtbook_code(s)
  s = s:gsub("#+", "#")
  s = s:gsub("(\\%a+) ", "%1")
  -- \%, \{ and \} are how a literal percent sign or an unbalanced brace has to be written inside
  -- a TeX argument, \# is how a # has to be written in a heading or a caption, and \\ is a
  -- lone backslash.
  s = s:gsub("\\([%%{}#\\])", "%1")
  -- A comma followed by a space needs nothing, because the space is a breakpoint already. Each
  -- tex.sprint is read as a line of its own and TeX skips the spaces a line starts with, so no
  -- chunk may begin with one.
  local start = 1
  while true do
    local i = s:find(",[^ ]", start)
    if not i then break end
    tex.sprint(catcode_other, s:sub(start, i))
    -- Discouraged rather than free, so a line breaks at a space when it can.
    tex.sprint("\\penalty100 ")
    start = i + 1
  end
  tex.sprint(catcode_other, s:sub(start))
end
