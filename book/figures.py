"""Render the course figures as vector PDFs for the book.

    .venv/bin/python book/figures.py OUTDIR [FIGURE...]

The lectures embed 130 dpi PNGs, which is right for a screen and soft on paper. The drawings
themselves are vector, so this reuses the figure builders in diagrams/ unchanged and swaps only
the last step: matplotlib writes a PDF instead of a palette PNG. Nothing in diagrams/ is modified,
and a figure changed there is changed here on the next build. With no FIGURE named, every figure
diagrams/build.py discovers is written, the teacher-only exam figures excepted.

The figures in the course that diagrams/ does not draw, the Microchip Studio and Arduino IDE
screenshots under info/images/, are screenshots rather than drawings, and the book includes those
PNGs as they are.
